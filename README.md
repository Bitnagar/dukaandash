The project was bootstrapped with Vite.

The `src` folder contains the `tsx` files and components that make up the dashboard. In the `root` of the project lies the `index.html` file.

The `public` folder contains assets such as icons.

The `src/components` folder contains all the components listed in their respective folders. For example `src/components/header` will contain the `<Header/>` component.
